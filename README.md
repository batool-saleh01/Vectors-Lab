# Vectors Lab
In this notebook you will learn how to graph two dimensional (2D) vectors and certain vector computations.

Specifically:
1. Plotting a 2D vector.
2. Multiplying a 2D vector by a scalar and plotting the results.
3. Adding two 2D vectors together and plotting the results.

For this lab, we will be using the python package ```NumPy``` for creating vectors and computing vector operations.
For the graphing aspects of the lab, we will be using python package ```Matplotlib```.
